# Presentation README file
This common file won't be included in the rendering of presentation(s).  
  
**Look through the files to learn about the structure/functionality of scenskrack presentations!**

## Things to note
- The files prefixed with "dot_" are typically hidden files, used this naming to make them obvious
- The "\_image\_originals" directory won't be included in output, due to the underscore prefix
- The "\_tmp" directory can be bind mounted over "/tmp" in container for debugging purposes
- Probably other things that I forgot: create an issue if you don't understand something!
